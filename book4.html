<p class=text><b>The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography</b><br>
<b>Author(s): Simon Singh</b><br><br>

The Code Book is an enlightening walk through the long-spanning history of encryption. It shows how encryption has played a role in shaping the course of the world — from defeating Hitler to making ecommerce possible (can you imagine how different world would be if either of those events didn’t happen?) and everything in between.
