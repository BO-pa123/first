<h1 class=header><u>CULT OF THE DEAD COW</u></h1>
<p class=text><b>Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World</b><br>
<b>Author(s)</b>: Joseph Menn<br><br>

Cult of the Dead Cow, if you didn’t know, refers to the oldest and most respected hacking group in the U.S. They aided in the development of TOR and, through their hacktivist efforts, forced many U.S. corporations to take their security protections to the next level. This book is all about their history and their impact on the world.<br><br>

The Cult of the Dead Cow is a hacking group that recently got a lot of attention because <u>[Beto] O’Rourke,</u> former candidate for the Democratic presidential nominee, was in it as a teenager. A largely anonymous group, the Cult of the Dead Cow practically invented hacktivism and greatly influenced large companies and their IT. The book outlines the group’s past as well as its present activities fighting fake news and surveillance.”
