<b>Author</b>: Jon Erickson<br><br>
<u>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</u> dives into the world of creative problem solving and exploitation.<br><br>       Rather than simply walking through how different exploits work, this book provides a holistic view of programming, network communications, and current hacking techniques. Unlike many cyber security books, this one comes with a LiveCD.<br><br>The disc provides a complete Linux environment to help you get your hands dirty with programming and debugging code â€” all without compromising or modifying your operating system (OS).  </p>
