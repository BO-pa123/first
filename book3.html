<h1 class=header><u>GHOST IN THE WIRES</u></h1>
<p class=text><b>Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker</b><br>
<b>Author(s)</b>: Kevin Mitnick, William L. Simon<br><br>

<u>Ghost in the Wires,</u> the second title on the list from Mitnick, is a brilliant first-hand account of his experiences accessing the networks and computers at some of the world’s biggest corporations — including Motorola, Pacific Bell, and Sun Microsystems.<br><br>

Another book by Kevin Mitnick, this option is a memoir from his career as an IT worker at large companies, dealing with the FBI. Although he’s just writing about coding, at the end of the day, Mitnick’s artful prose makes it as exciting as a thriller. Personally, I wasn’t able to put it down until I finished!”
